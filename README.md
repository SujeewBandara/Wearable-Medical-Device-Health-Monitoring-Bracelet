# Wearable-Medical-Device-Health-Monitoring-Bracelet

I designed the complete circuit and final PCB layout for this wearable medical device, developed to monitor patient health in real time. Worn like a bracelet, it tracks key vitals including heart rate, blood oxygen level (SpO‚ÇÇ), body temperature, and physical orientation. The device stores data on an SD card and transmits it to the cloud, allowing doctors to remotely access and assess patient health through custom software. This solution is ideal for continuous home monitoring, especially for elderly patients or during health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

## üìã Project Overview

The wearable device is developed to monitor the following key vital signs:
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Heart Rate**
- üå¨Ô∏è **Blood Oxygen Level (SpO‚ÇÇ)**
- üå°Ô∏è **Body Temperature**
- üß≠ **Physical Orientation** (using an IMU sensor)

The data can be stored locally on an SD card and transmitted to the cloud for real-time remote monitoring by healthcare professionals. This makes the device ideal for:
- Elderly care and chronic illness monitoring
- Home-based quarantine scenarios (e.g., COVID-19)
- Post-operative recovery monitoring

## üí° My Role

I was responsible for designing:
- The **complete circuit schematic**
- The **final PCB layout** (Version 1), optimized for a smartwatch-sized wearable device

Key contributions:
- Compact, power-efficient PCB suitable for wrist-wearable enclosures
- Integration of vital sign sensors with reliable signal pathways
- Support for future firmware and wireless connectivity (e.g., ESP32 module)
